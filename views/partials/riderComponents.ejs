      <li><strong>EMAIL HACKING & WIRE FRAUD ARE REAL.</strong> Criminals can hack email accounts and send emails with fake wiring instructions. These emails may look exactly like legitimate emails from parties in the transaction.</li>
      <li><strong>ALWAYS VERIFY WIRE INSTRUCTIONS IN PERSON OR BY PHONE.</strong> Prior to wiring any funds, you should personally call the intended recipient to verify the wire instructions using a phone number that is independently obtained (not from the email containing the wiring instructions).</li>
      <li><strong>BE SUSPICIOUS OF ANY CHANGES.</strong> Any request to change wire instructions should be treated with suspicion. Always verify changes through a known, trusted phone number.</li>
