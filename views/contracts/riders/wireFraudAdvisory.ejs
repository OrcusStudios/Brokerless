    <p>This Wire Fraud Advisory Rider is attached to and forms a part of the Residential Real Estate Purchase Agreement between Buyer and Seller.</p>

    <p><strong>Wire Fraud Risks:</strong> Criminals target real estate transactions to intercept sensitive information such as social security numbers, bank account details, and wire instructions. Funds sent to fraudulent accounts are typically not recoverable and are not covered by insurance.</p>

    <p><strong>Protecting Your Funds:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Do <strong>NOT</strong> trust unsolicited emails containing wire instructions. Always verify by calling your escrow or title officer directly using verified contact information.</li>
        <li>Do <strong>NOT</strong> disclose personal or financial information in response to unexpected emails or attachments. Confirm any unusual requests with a direct call.</li>
        <li>Before wiring funds, always meet or directly call the intended recipient using contact information obtained independently.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Acknowledgment:</strong> Buyer acknowledges receipt and understanding of this Wire Fraud Advisory Rider.</p>
