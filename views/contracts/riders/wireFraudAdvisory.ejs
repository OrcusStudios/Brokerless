        <h5>Wire Fraud Advisory</h5>
        <p><span class="warning">Criminals target social media and email to steal information.</span> This is particularly common in real estate transactions where sensitive data such as social security numbers, bank account details, and wire instructions are exchanged electronically. <strong>WE DO NOT WANT YOU TO BE THE NEXT VICTIM OF WIRE FRAUD!</strong></p>
        
        <p>Money wired to a fraudulent account is stolen and typically cannot be recovered. Additionally, there is generally no insurance coverage for this loss.</p>
        
        <h6>DO NOT TRUST EMAILS CONTAINING WIRE INSTRUCTIONS</h6>
        <ul>
            <li>If you receive an email containing wire transfer instructions, <strong>immediately</strong> call your trusted escrow officer to verify its authenticity.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h6>DO NOT TRUST EMAILS SEEKING PERSONAL/FINANCIAL INFORMATION</h6>
        <ul>
            <li>If you receive an email requesting personal or financial information, asking you to download an attachment, click a link, or do anything unusual, call your escrow officer immediately to verify its validity.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h6>ONLY TRUST YOUR KNOWN SOURCE OF INFORMATION</h6>
        <ul>
            <li>Never direct, accept, or allow anyone to change wire transfer instructions without first making a <strong>direct personal telephone call</strong> to verify the senderâ€™s identity.</li>
            <li>Always use a phone number that you obtained in person or through other reliable sources, <strong>not</strong> from an email or new wiring instructions.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h6>VERIFY BEFORE YOU WIRE FUNDS</h6>
        <p>Before wiring funds to anyone (e.g., your lawyer, title agent, mortgage broker, or real estate agent), personally meet them or call a <strong>verified</strong> telephone number to confirm, both before and after the transfer.</p>
        
        <h2>REPORT FRAUD IMMEDIATELY</h2>
        <p>If you suspect or become a victim of wire fraud, notify governmental officials, your banking institution, and your settlement/title company immediately.</p>
