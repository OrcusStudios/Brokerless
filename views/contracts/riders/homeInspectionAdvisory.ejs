    <p>This Home Inspection Advisory Rider is attached to and forms a part of the Residential Real Estate Purchase Agreement between Buyer and Seller.</p>

    <p><strong>For Your Protection: Get a Home Inspection</strong></p>
    <p>A home inspection is highly recommended but not required by law. Buyers are encouraged to engage a professional home inspector to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Evaluate the physical condition, structure, and systems of the Property.</li>
        <li>Identify necessary repairs.</li>
        <li>Estimate the remaining life of major components.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>The Appraisal is NOT a Home Inspection:</strong> An appraisal estimates the Propertyâ€™s market value for the lender and does not evaluate the condition for the Buyer.</p>

    <p><strong>Additional Inspections:</strong> Buyers may request further inspections, including but not limited to radon, health, safety, or energy efficiency tests.</p>

    <p><strong>Acknowledgment:</strong> Buyeracknowledges receipt and understanding of this Home Inspection Advisory Rider.</p>
