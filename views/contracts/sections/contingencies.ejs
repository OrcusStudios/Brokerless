The appraisal must be conducted by a licensed Missouri appraiser chosen by either the Buyer or the Buyer's lender. The Seller agrees to grant reasonable access to the Property for this purpose, provided the Buyer gives reasonable advance notice.

                                        If the appraised value comes in lower than the Purchase Price, the Buyer has the option to request a price reduction, though the adjusted price cannot be below the appraised value. To invoke this contingency, the Buyer must submit a written request, along with a copy of the appraisal, to the Seller no later than ong> days from the Effective Date. Failure to provide this notice within the required timeframe will result in the automatic waiver of this contingency.

In that case, the Earnest Money will be refunded to the Buyer, unless the Buyer formally waives the contingency by notifying the Seller before the Appraisal Resolution Deadline. If the Purchase Price is adjusted, the loan amount specified in the Buyer's financing contingency (if applicable) will be proportionally reduced.</div>

If no such notice is delivered by the deadline, this financing contingency will be considered waived, and the Buyer's obligation under this Contract will no longer depend on obtaining financing. However, if the lender refuses to provide the required notice, the Buyer may instead submit a notarized affidavit to the Seller before the deadline, affirming that all reasonable efforts were made to secure financing but the required notice could not be obtained.
