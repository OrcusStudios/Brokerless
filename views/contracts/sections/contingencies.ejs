    <p>This Agreement is contingent upon the satisfaction or waiver of the following conditions:</p>
  
    <!-- Financing Contingency -->
    <h5 class="mt-3">5.1 Financing Contingency</h5>
    <% if (offer.financingType && offer.financingType !== 'Cash') { %>
      <p>Buyer’s obligation to purchase is contingent upon Buyer obtaining a <strong><%= offer.financingType %></strong> loan in the amount of <strong>$<%= offer.loanAmount %></strong> with an interest rate not exceeding <%= offer.interestRate ? offer.interestRate + '%' : '___%' %>. Buyer agrees to apply promptly and use reasonable efforts to secure financing approval by <strong><%= offer.financingDeadline %></strong>.</p>
    <% } else { %>
      <p>Buyer has elected to proceed with a cash purchase. No financing contingency applies.</p>
    <% } %>
  
    <!-- Inspection Contingency -->
    <h5 class="mt-3">5.2 Inspection Contingency</h5>
    <p>This Agreement is contingent upon Buyer’s right to conduct inspections of the Property, including but not limited to structural, mechanical, pest, and environmental inspections. Buyer shall complete all inspections within <strong><%= offer.inspectionDeadlineDays || '15' %> days</strong> after the effective date of this Agreement.</p>
    <p>Buyer may terminate this Agreement based on inspection results or request repairs in writing within said period. Failure to do so shall constitute acceptance of the Property in its present condition.</p>
  
    <!-- Appraisal Contingency -->
    <h5 class="mt-3">5.3 Appraisal Contingency</h5>
    <p>This Agreement is contingent upon the Property appraising at or above the Purchase Price. This contingency allows for <strong><%= offer.appraisalDeadlineDays || '25 days' %></strong> unless this contract is included with a <strong>Government Loan Rider.</strong> In such case this contingency is null and void, with the Government Loan Rider taking priority. Should the appraisal result in a value less than the Purchase Price, Buyer may elect to renegotiate, proceed, or terminate this Agreement and recover the Earnest Money.</p>
  
    <!-- Title Contingency -->
    <h5 class="mt-3">5.4 Title Contingency</h5>
    <p>Seller shall convey clear, marketable title to the Property. Buyer shall have the right to review title commitment and related documents within <strong>5 days.</strong> Any defects must be reported to Seller within this period. Failure to correct title issues allows Buyer to terminate and receive Earnest Money refund.</p>
  
    <!-- Sale of Buyer's Property Contingency -->
    <% if (offer.contingencies.includes("Sale of Buyer's Property")) { %>
      <h5 class="mt-3">5.5 Sale of Buyer's Property</h5>
      <p>Closing of this sale is contingent upon Buyer's successful sale and closing of their property located at <strong><%= offer.listingAddress %>, <%= offer.listingCity %>, <%= offer.listingState %>, <%= offer.listingZip %></strong> on or before <strong><%= offer.closingDate || '_____' %></strong>. Buyer shall notify Seller promptly upon sale completion.</p>
    <% } %>
  
    <!-- Other Contingencies -->
    <% if (offer.additionalContingencies && offer.additionalContingencies.length > 0) { %>
      <h5 class="mt-3">5.6 Additional Contingencies</h5>
      <ul class="ms-4">
        <% offer.additionalContingencies.forEach(function(item) { %>
          <li><%= item %></li>
        <% }); %>
      </ul>
    <% } %>
  
    <!-- Failure to Satisfy -->
    <h5 class="mt-3">5.7 Failure to Satisfy Contingencies</h5>
